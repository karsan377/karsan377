# Karthik Sankaran

I’m a Data Science (spec. Biology & AI/ML) student at UC San Diego (GPA 3.95) with experience in building data-driven applications, full-stack systems, and machine learning pipelines. If you're hiring or want to talk soccer (football), reach out.

## Highlights
- **Wildfire Risk Detection Web App** – Built and deployed a full-stack app (Flask, HTML/CSS, Render) integrating weather + geolocation data. Trained a CNN (MobileNetV2) to classify wildfire imagery with ~90% accuracy.  
- **Air Quality ETL Pipeline** – Automated pollutant data collection and processing (Python, SQLite), cutting latency from days to hours. Designed Streamlit dashboards to visualize wildfire risks.  
- **RAG Pipeline for Q&A** – Implemented document retrieval + question answering (Ollama LLM, Chroma DB) with semantic search and scalable chunk management.  
- **Real-Time Sports AI** – Prototyped goal predictor using PyAudio feature extraction + scikit-learn classification. Achieved 65% accuracy with sub-5s latency.  

## Technical Skills
